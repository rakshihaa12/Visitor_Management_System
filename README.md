## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes:**
- This application uses basic authentication for demonstration purposes
- In production environments, implement proper authentication and authorization
- Consider using server-side storage for sensitive visitor data
- Add input sanitization and validation for security
- Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission

## Limitations

- **Client-Side Only**: All data is stored locally in the browser
- **Single User**: Designed for single-user access
- **Basic Authentication**: Simple login system (not production-ready)
- **Browser Dependent**: Data is tied to specific browser/device

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the system:
- [ ] Multi-user support with role-based access
- [ ] Database integration for persistent storage
- [ ] Email notifications for visit confirmations
- [ ] Photo capture for visitor identification
- [ ] Visit status tracking (checked in/out)
- [ ] Reporting and analytics features
- [ ] Integration with calendar systems
- [ ] QR code generation for visitor passes
